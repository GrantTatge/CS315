I worked on this project with Burke and Danny from this year's CS315 section.

For the sorted vector, I used a helper function for resorting when inserting and removing. Beyond this,
I stuck quite closely to the methods that were given. I am unsure if my implementation for the removal
time is correct, and if it needs to be averaged out or not. I'm also surprised at how slowly the sorted vector's
insertion times are. For time's (and my sanity's) sake, I changed N = 500000 to N = 50000.

From what I see, everything works as intended. I'm worried that the runtime for several of the methods are longer
than they should be, but from what I can tell, my algorithms should be fine.
