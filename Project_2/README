I talked to several of my classmates about the project, but I didn't get a chance to work on it with them this time.
They did remind me that I can use member() when we were talking about it, so a few functions that should do that don't.

The design is exactly as it was asked to be. I did write test functions for each function in my main.cpp, but I know that's not going to be used..

I unfortunately did not get around to finishing list_union() or subset(). Other than that, everything works on my end and on Blue.
